# Investigating-Data-Set-Project
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it.
In this project, I have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. I have also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier.
